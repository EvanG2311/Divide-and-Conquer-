# Divide-and-Conquer-
This project implements a divide and conquer algorithm to compute the maximum profit obtainable from buying and selling a stock exactly once. The input is an array of doubles, where each value A[i] represents the price of a stock on day i. The goal is to choose a buy day and a later sell day such that the profit A[sellDay] – A[buyDay] is maximized.
